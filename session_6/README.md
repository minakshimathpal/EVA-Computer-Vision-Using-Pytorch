### Key Idea: Replacing Maxpooling by strided convolutions(i.e convolution layer with a stride of 2 
        `we can think of strided convolutions as learnable pooling`
Replacing maxpoling with convolution layer with stride of 2 will be a little bit more expensive, because we have now more parameters. 
But in that way, we can also simplify the network in terms of having it look simpler, just saying,okay, we only use convolutions, we don't use anything else, if
that's desirable. We still need the activation function, but we don't need pooling layers, for example. I
 will be a bit costly operation but
